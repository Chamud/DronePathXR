# Gesture-Driven Drone Route Generation System Using Extended Reality

## Overview
A research project focused on developing an intuitive gesture-based system for generating drone routes using Extended Reality (XR) technology, specifically designed for video capture and 3D mapping applications.

## Introduction
Drones are increasingly utilized for video production, 3D mapping, and surveying tasks. Traditional route generation systems rely on 2D interfaces and manual waypoint specification, which can be time-consuming and unintuitive. This project aims to revolutionize drone control by integrating natural gesture recognition with XR technology, enabling more intuitive and efficient route generation.

## Objectives
- Develop a gesture recognition system for intuitive drone route definition
- Implement real-time route visualization through XR interfaces
- Create a user-friendly route confirmation and adjustment system

## Technical Approach

### 1. Gesture Recognition
- XR headset-based hand and finger tracking
- Machine learning models for gesture interpretation
- Support for various gestures:
  - Directional pointing
  - Route shape definition
  - Speed and FOV control

### 2. Route Generation
- Integration of gesture inputs with environmental data
- Obstacle avoidance and path optimization
- Dynamic speed and angle adjustments

### 3. Virtual Route Visualization
- Real-time XR environment representation
- Interactive route overlay and modification
- User feedback system

## Applications
- Film and Media Production
- Surveying and 3D Mapping
- Disaster Management and Search & Rescue
- Industrial Inspection

## Technical Challenges
- Gesture recognition accuracy in varying conditions
- Complex terrain recognition
- Real-time route visualization

## Expected Outcomes
1. Functional gesture-driven drone control prototype
2. XR-based route visualization system
3. Autonomous execution capabilities
4. Practical use case demonstrations
